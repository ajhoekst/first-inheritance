# Description
Coding exercise for FIRST Robotics students - inheritance

# Instructions
A basic class hierarchy has been built for you. There are four levels of difficulty to challenge you:
1. **Basic:** Implement the 2D shape interfaces defined by the following headers:
- [triangle.h](https://github.com/ajhoekst/first-inheritance/blob/master/inc/triangle.h)
- [rectangle.h](https://github.com/ajhoekst/first-inheritance/blob/master/inc/rectangle.h)
- [circle.h](https://github.com/ajhoekst/first-inheritance/blob/master/inc/circle.h)
- [square.h](https://github.com/ajhoekst/first-inheritance/blob/master/inc/square.h)
2. **Intermediate:** Implement the 3D shape interfaces defined by the following headers:
- [box.h](https://github.com/ajhoekst/first-inheritance/blob/master/inc/box.h)
- [cube.h](https://github.com/ajhoekst/first-inheritance/blob/master/inc/cube.h)
- [sphere.h](https://github.com/ajhoekst/first-inheritance/blob/master/inc/sphere.h)
3. **Advanced:** Design the 3D shape interfaces and implement, using the following headers:
- [pyramid.h](https://github.com/ajhoekst/first-inheritance/blob/master/inc/pyramid.h)
- [tetrahedron.h](https://github.com/ajhoekst/first-inheritance/blob/master/inc/tetrahedron.h)
4. **Expert:** How can we compare shapes to determine if they are the same shape? [Hint](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/operators)
