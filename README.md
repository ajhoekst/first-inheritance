#Description
Coding exercise for FIRST Robotics students - inheritance

#Instructions
A basic class hierarchy has been built for you. There are three levels of difficulty to challenge you:
1. Basic: Implement the 2D shape interfaces defined by the following headers:
- triangle.h
- rectangle.h
- circle.h
- square.h
2. Intermediate: Implement the 3D shape interfaces defined by the following headers:
- box.h
- cube.h
- sphere.h
3. Advanced: Design the 3D shape interfaces and implement, using the following headers:
- pyramid.h
- tetrahedron.h
4. Expert: How can we compare shapes to determine if they are the same shape?
